Calculator to calculate unrealized gains or losses in % and $ form. 

The problem: 

  Purchasing crypto currency on Coinbase is a very user-friendly and fast way to own different coins or tokens.
As an investor its important to keep track of unrealized and realized gains/losses, to have as much information on an investment
is key in making monetary decisions (to buy, to sell, or to hold). 

Coinbase does not have a gain or loss display on their applications. Neither in % or $ amount. 

The solution:

  To solve the issues I needed to make sure I had the correct calculations to present proper percent change and average cost of user inputs. 
From there I created a calculator that prompts for the basis investment, the amount of the asset owned, and the current market value to calculate
the gain or loss as a percent, dollar amount, the average cost of one asset held. All in an organized and presentable display. 

Thank you for taking the time to read!
